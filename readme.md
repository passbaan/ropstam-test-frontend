# Requirements
```
On the front end, there should be a sign-in & sign-up page.

After sign-up, the system should send a welcome email to the user and a randomly generated password to log in to the system later. You can use any preferred method for sending emails.

On successful login, there should be a simple dashboard showing the number of registered cars in your system.
